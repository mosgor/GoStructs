# GoStructs
GoStructs â€” A library that provides basic data structures and their rare variations made with generics.   
**Installation**: ```go get github.com/mosgor/GoStructs```

There are such data structures: 
1) [Heap](#heap)
    - [MaxHeap](#maxheap)
    - [MinHeap](#minheap)
## Heap
Tree-based sorted data structure.
Every operation takes about $O(log{n})$.  
Every slice can be transformed to the Heap with $O(n)$ complexity.  
It's based on slices, so such functions as len or cap are also **working** with it.   
   
Every Heap type supports all int types, all uint types (including uintptr), floats, and strings

### MaxHeap
Import path: ```github.com/mosgor/GoStructs/pkg/maxHeap```  
Heap sorted from the biggest number to the smallest.  
There are such methods implemented in MaxHeap:
- **Insert.** Inserts an element into a Heap. Takes this element as an argument. Returns error value if the receiver is nil.
- **Extract.** Extracts the biggest element of the Heap and returns it and the true bool value.    
When we try to extract from an empty Heap or when the receiver is nil,
we get the default value of a type contained in the Heap and the false bool value.
- **Max.** Returns the biggest element of the Heap and the true bool value.   
When this method is used on an empty Heap or when the receiver is nil,
  we get the default value of a type contained in the Heap and the false bool value.

There is only one function:
- **Heapify.** It takes slice as an argument and returns new Heap consisting of slice elements.

### MinHeap
